# Project: Emotion Recognition using EEG based Data DEED IV.

This Python project aims to predict emotions in individuals based on EEG-based data. The project utilizes transfer **learning techniques** , including **EEGITNET**  , to build a predictive model.

### Getting Started
These instructions will guide you on how to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x, GPU and the following libraries installed:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* pickle
* mne
* tensorflow-addons

###### You can install these libraries using the following command:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn pickle

### Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- tl_helper.py : All helper function to read and explore the data files.
- bci_ml_cross_subject_eeg_itnet.py: Implemented simple Base model for cross subject classifcation.
- bci_tl_cross_subject_eeg_itnet.py: Implemented transfer learning for cross subject classifcation.
- bci_ml_within_subject_eeg_itnet.py: Implemented simple Base model for within subject classifcation
- bci_tl_within_subject_eeg_itnet.py: Implemented transfer learning for within subject classifcation

* Usage
To run the project, simply execute the relevant file. This will preprocess the data, extract relevant features, train the model with EEGITNET, and evaluate the model's performance.

Make sure to include all the necessary details to help users understand the project and its functionality.
